## About the course

See [the main course page](https://nipraxis.org) for an overall description of the course, including a rough schedule of classes.

## About this iteration

Please note, this is a *pilot* version of the course.  The first full version of the course will be the Fall 2022 iteration.  The Fall 2022 iteration will run from around the beginning of August to the end of September.

Expect the pilot course to be a little rough round the edges, but otherwise
complete and coherent.   We will use the pilot to make sure we have the
technology working and to iron out an issues with organization and scheduling.

## When will it be?

The course will run from early May to the beginning of July, 2022.

## Why should I join the pilot?

The advantage to you, in joining this first version of the class, is that we will enroll a much small number of students.  This will give you a lot more contact time with us, the instructors.   You will also have some influence in what we teach and how we teach, because we always find we adapt the materials to the questions and problems that come up.

Who knows, you might also consider becoming a Teaching Assistant for the Fall iteration.  You might do this if you want teaching experience, and if you want to learn more from us, your instructors.

## How to I join

Please contact one of the instructors by email - see the instructors page.
