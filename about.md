## About

See the [main course page](https://nipraxis.org)

## Lecture

There will be two lectures per week, live and on Zoom, each of 2 hours.

We will organize times for the lectures when we have enough students who have enrolled on the course.

## Resources

See [this 2016 Berkeley
course](https://bic-berkeley.github.io/psych-214-fall-2016/) for some idea of
what the course will be like.

We wrote up a similar course in [Frontiers in
Neuroimaging](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.00727).

## Assignments

We will give you an average of 1.5 hours of assignments to do each week, which
we will mark, and give you feedback for.

There is a mid-course group project to practice collaboration on code.  We
expect this to take you 2 weeks to complete, at roughly 2 hours per week per
person.

The final course assignment is a more substantial and open-ended group
project, where each group selects and proposes its own data to work on, and
the analysis strategy.  We will give you examples and suggestions for you to
work from, if you are finding it hard to come up with ideas.
